Q3 algorithm

1. ask user to input 3 numbers n1,n3,n3
2. Compare n1 with n2 and n3
3. If n1 is greatest
 Print "n1 is the greatest number"
4. Else compare n2 with n1 and n3
5. If n2 is greatest
Print "n2 is greatest"
6. Else print "n3 is greatest"

Pseudo code:
START
INPUT NUM1
INPUT NUM2
INPUT NUM3

IF NUM1>NUM2 AND NUM1>NUM3 THEN
       PRINT "Num1 is the greatest number"
ELSE IF NUM2>NUM1 AND NUM2>NUM3 THEN
        PRINT "Num2 is the greatest number"
ELSE 
        PRINT " Num3 is the greatest number"
ENDIF

END
